# Improvement Tasks for Rust gRPC Server

This document contains a checklist of tasks for improving the Rust gRPC server project. Tasks are organized by category and should be completed in the order presented for optimal results.

## Project Structure and Organization

1. [ ] Create a comprehensive README.md with project description, setup instructions, and usage examples
2. [ ] Implement a modular project structure by moving service implementations to separate modules
3. [ ] Add a CHANGELOG.md file to track version changes
4. [ ] Create a .gitignore file for Rust projects
5. [ ] Add license information to the project

## Configuration Management

6. [ ] Implement configuration loading from environment variables
7. [ ] Add support for configuration files (TOML/YAML)
8. [ ] Make server address and port configurable
9. [ ] Implement different configuration profiles (development, testing, production)
10. [ ] Add command-line argument parsing for runtime configuration

## Error Handling and Logging

11. [ ] Implement proper error handling with custom error types
12. [ ] Add a logging framework (e.g., tracing or log + env_logger)
13. [ ] Implement structured logging for better observability
14. [ ] Add request/response logging middleware
15. [ ] Implement error reporting and monitoring hooks

## Testing and Quality Assurance

16. [ ] Add unit tests for service implementations
17. [ ] Implement integration tests for the gRPC service
18. [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline configuration
19. [ ] Add code coverage reporting
20. [ ] Implement property-based testing for robust validation

## Security Enhancements

21. [ ] Implement TLS/SSL for secure communication
22. [ ] Add authentication mechanisms (e.g., API keys, JWT)
23. [ ] Implement authorization and access control
24. [ ] Add rate limiting to prevent abuse
25. [ ] Perform security audit and fix any vulnerabilities

## Performance Optimization

26. [ ] Implement connection pooling for database or external service connections
27. [ ] Add caching mechanisms where appropriate
28. [ ] Optimize protobuf message definitions
29. [ ] Implement request timeout handling
30. [ ] Add performance benchmarks

## Documentation

31. [ ] Add inline documentation for all public APIs
32. [ ] Generate API documentation with cargo doc
33. [ ] Create architectural documentation explaining system design
34. [ ] Document deployment procedures
35. [ ] Add examples directory with sample client implementations

## Feature Enhancements

36. [ ] Implement health check endpoint
37. [ ] Add metrics collection and reporting
38. [ ] Implement graceful shutdown
39. [ ] Add support for streaming RPCs
40. [ ] Implement service discovery integration

## Maintenance and Operations

41. [ ] Add Dockerfile and docker-compose configuration
42. [ ] Implement database migrations if applicable
43. [ ] Create backup and restore procedures
44. [ ] Add monitoring and alerting configuration
45. [ ] Document operational runbooks for common scenarios
